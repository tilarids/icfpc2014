THIRTEEN's ICFPC 2014 source code
=================================

TL;DR; We enjoy writing compilers, emulators, preprocessors. That's why we wrote two GCC compilers, two (three?) GHC preprocessors and one emulator. Compilers = fun, writing actual game AI code = not that much.

Subfolders:

* GHCAsm - assembler for GHC written in C.
* java - main code lives here. You can find Java to GCC compiler, GCC emulator, GHC preprocessor and the Lambdaman AI in there. 
* native - some native GCC code snippets.
* solution - the final solution.
* tilarids - experimental JS to GCC compiler.
* www - extracted js/html game emulator.

Various files in the root folder represent our efforts to crack out the bkg2.png pic. :)

Also, you can read a [post-mortem here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qYjmSkIH_BEGhd2j_3G_f-Xrkx8rrdr1M9TkGaBtxGI/pub)(it is in Russian!).
